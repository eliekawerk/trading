    "#### Run-Day Consecutive Count System\n",
    "+ This is a trend-reversal/initiation identification system\n",
    "+ Reversal signals occur when a specified number of up/down run days without any intervening down/up\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Up Run Day\n",
    "+ The true high of the run day is greater than the maximum true high of past N days\n",
    "+ The true low of the run day is less than the minimum true low on the subsequent N days\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Down Run Day\n",
    "+ The true low of the run day is less then the minimum of true low of the past N days\n",
    "+ The true high of the run day is greater than the maximum true high of the subsequent N days\n",

    "#### Buy Count\n",
    "+ Activated whenever a sell signal is received.\n",
    "+ Count starts at zero and increases by one whenever a new up run day is defined\n",
    "+ Count is reset to zero whenever there is a down run day\n",

    "#### Daily Checklist\n",
    "+ Check whether the trading day N1 days prior to curreny day can be defined as up run day or down run day\n",
    "+ If day is up run day increase buy count by one, if buy count is active and you are currently short, otherwise reset the sell count to zero\n",
    "+ Buy or sell count is always active depending on position\n",
    "+ If day is a down run day increment the sell count by one, otherwise reset buy count to zero\n",
    "+ If buy count is active, check whether it is equal to N2 after step 1. \n",
    "    + If active, cover short, go long, close buy count, activate sell count\n",
    "+ If sell count is active, check whether it is equal to N2 after step 1\n",
    "    + If active, cover long, go short, close sell count, activate buy count\n",
